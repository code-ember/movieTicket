Movie Ticket Booking Application

## INTRODUCTION
Amy is developing a simple movie ticket booking application and needs your help. The program must store the user's name, the movie title, the number of tickets, and the price per ticket. The program will then calculate the total cost, apply some string manipulations, and display a detailed booking confirmation message.

## THE GOAL
Help Amy develop her program by declaring and initializing variables, calculating ticket prices, applying string manipulation, and formatting user-facing output? 
You'll need to write some robust code to help Amy develop her application. 

## DECLARE AND INITIALIZE THE VARIABLES
You need to declare and initialize the variables for the following:
- First name
- Last name
- Movie title
- Number of tickets
- Price per ticket
Then, you need to calculate the total ticket price using the assigned number of tickets and the cost per ticket.

STEP 1: Declare and initialize variables
-  Inside the main method, declare and initialize the outlined variables.

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
- First Name: Sandy
- Last Name: Jones
- Movie: The Source Code
- Number of Tickets: 8
- Price per ticket in USD: 10.57

STEP 2: Calculate the total ticket price
- Once you’ve printed all the details of the initialized variables, you need to calculate the ticket's total price using the number of tickets and the price per ticket variables you created. Be sure to assign a variable to the calculated total price so that you can use it in later calculations.

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
- Total Price of 8 tickets: 84.56

## PERFORM STRING OPERATIONS TO FORMAT THE OUTPUT
Amy is very impressed that you’ve coded her program to declare and initialize relevant variables and calculate the total cost of tickets. Next, she needs your help in formatting the strings for the final output. 

STEP 3: Concatenate the first name and last name to get the username 
- So far, you’ve calculated the total price of eight tickets. However, every system needs a user name. Here we create a username by concatenating the first name and the last name and converting it all to lower case. Your job is to concatenate the first name and the last name and convert it to lower case and assign it to a new variable named “*userName*”.

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
- Username: sandyjones

STEP 4: Convert the movie title to upper case to highlight it in the ticket
- You have successfully created the username. Now, you need to highlight the movie name in the final ticket, so you will have to convert the *movieTitle* to uppercase

EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
- Movie: THE SOURCE CODE

STEP 5: Print the final expected output
- Now that you have calculated the final price, you must print out the final output for validation. 

FINAL EXPECTED OUTPUT: 
- Congratulations!! You have successfully booked the tickets

- Username: sandyjones
- Movie: THE SOURCE CODE
- Number of Tickets: 8
- Price per ticket: $10.57
- Total price of 8 tickets: $84.56

- Thank you for choosing us for booking your movie tickets
- Enjoy your movie!!!

## CONCLUSION
Amy with her movie ticket booking application, you’ve applied these foundational skills in a practical scenario. Your ability to declare and initialize variables, perform arithmetic operations, and manipulate Strings to create formatted output is impressive - it certainly impressed Amy!
