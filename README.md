# Movie Ticket Booking Application

## Introduction
This project is a simple **Movie Ticket Booking Application** designed to demonstrate core Java concepts. The application allows users to store their details (such as name and movie title), calculate ticket prices, and display a detailed booking confirmation message with formatted output.

## Features
1. Stores user information, including:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Movie title
   - Number of tickets
   - Price per ticket
2. Calculates the total cost based on the number of tickets and price per ticket.
3. Formats and displays:
   - User name in lowercase.
   - Movie title in uppercase.
4. Outputs a detailed booking confirmation message.

## Steps to Implement
### Step 1: Declare and Initialize Variables
- Create and initialize variables for user details and ticket prices.

**Expected Output:**
```
First Name: Sandy 
Last Name: Jones 
Movie: The Source Code 
Number of Tickets: 8 
Price per ticket in USD: 10.57
```

### Step 2: Calculate Total Price
- Compute the total cost using the number of tickets and price per ticket.

**Expected Output:**
```
Total Price of 8 tickets: 84.56
```

### Step 3: Perform String Operations
- Concatenate the first name and last name to create a `username` in lowercase.
- Convert the movie title to uppercase for emphasis.

**Expected Output:**
```
Username: sandyjones
Movie: THE SOURCE CODE
```

### Step 4: Final Output
- Display a formatted ticket confirmation message with all details.

**Final Output:**
```
Congratulations!! You have successfully booked the tickets.
